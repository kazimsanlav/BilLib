##  Introduction 
Bilkent  students  have  some  difficulty  to  find  book’s location with  current system  in  the  library.  There  are  lots  of  letters  and  numbers  that  symbolize  locations  so  it  makes  student lose time.  Thus,  I  decided  to  develop  a  mobile  application  that  helps  student  to  find  book’s  location easily.  It is aimed that  the  program should  be  basic  that  can  be  used  by  all  students  and  staff  easily.  It is also aimed that  the  application  gives  people  ability  to  find  book’s  location  by  using  visual  description.  Finally, it is  decided  that  the  program  should  be  written  in  Android  environment,  so  that  students  can  use  the  app  in  their  mobile  phones  at  the  library  and  can  get  notifications.
